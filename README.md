# Personal Website

This project was developed by me. It's a personal website with such sections as portfolio, about info, resume, etc. which are to be updated later on.

## Used Tech

In the project I used mainly React and CSS in order to achieve both the desired outlook and responsive, mobile-friendly design.

The web application is deployed to Netlify. You can check it out here:
